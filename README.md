# ClockJS

## I've created an analog clock plus the digital one with JavaScript basic concepts.

## What we've explored inside the project:
- Data manipulating
- How to implement hours, minutes, seconds within our application.
- functions to manipulate and work with the DOM

I's a powerfull project with JavaScript basics knowledge but it could help us a lot. 
I hope you'll enjoy it.
